# Mailing Lists, Forums, and Chat

<!-- markdownlint-disable foo -->

There are several ways to connect with the SmartOS and Illumos
communities.

## Mailing Lists & Forums

The best place to talk about SmartOS is the [smartos-discuss mailing
list](https://smartos.topicbox.com/groups/smartos-discuss). If you wish
to send mail to the list you'll need to join, but you can view and
search the archives online without being a member. The discussion list
is the best way to find a broad range of people who may be working on
the same problems or have answered the same questions you have.

There are also other related mailing lists for software included in, or
related to, SmartOS; e.g.,

* [SmartOS Mailing List](https://smartos.topicbox.com/groups/smartos-discuss)
* [Triton Data Center](https://smartdatacenter.topicbox.com/groups/sdc*discuss)
  (Compute Service built on SmartOS)
* [Manta Object Storage](https://mantastorage.topicbox.com/groups/manta*discuss)

* Reddit
    * [r/smartos](https://reddit.com/r/smartos)
    * [r/illumos](https://reddit.com/r/illumos)

## Chat

Real time chat is a great way to connect with other SmartOS users,
and (perhaps) get quick answers to questions when you're in the middle
of something and need advice.
