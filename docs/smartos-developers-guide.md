# SmartOS Developers Guide

An open source operating system is only as powerful and diverse as its
community of developers. Success requires drawing upon a wide variety of
talents, skills, and passions.  From innovative new groundbreaking
features to simple bug and security fixes, the SmartOS community needs a
host of developers with skills at every level.

Here you will find guidance on how to begin your journey as a SmartOS
Developer.
