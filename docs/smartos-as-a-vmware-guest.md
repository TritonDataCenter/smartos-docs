# SmartOS as a VMware Guest

## VMware Fusion

To get started with SmartOS on VMware Fusion, [download the latest
VMware image](download-smartos.md).

Once downloaded, extract it. Mac OS X example:

    tar -jxvf Downloads/smartos-latest.vmwarevm.tar.bz2 -C ~/Documents/Virtual\ Machines.localized/

The SmartOS.vmwarevm image is a ready-to-run VM. There's no need to import
or create a new VM from the image.

The VM is ready to go, simply go to the "File" menu and select "Open".
The navigate to the directory where you extract the image and the
"SmartOS.vmwarevm". Click on it and click "Open".
The VM should immediately pop up in a new window, allowing you to start
it.  Click the "Play" then choose "I copied it".

It will boot.  You should be greeted by the boot loader.

Allow the default boot target to boot ("Live 64-bit (text)").  In this
case "text" refers to the standard keyboard and monitor console, you
would select one of the ttya options if you required console redirection
to COM1 (ttya), which in a VMware environment you do not.

On first boot, the "SmartOS Setup" program will run.  Follow its prompts
to do the initial setup of your machine.

Do not use the first disk presented for the storage pool (`c0t0d0`).
This is the boot media and overwriting it will make the machine not boot
anymore.

### Virtualization Hardware Extensions

If you are using VMware Fusion 5 or newer on a system with Intel VT-x
extensions such as a newer MacBook Pro, you can enable pass through to
allow nested virtualization capabilities allowing you to use KVM within
SmartOS on top of VMware. To enable this, go to your VM's settings while
its powered down and change the compatibility to "Fusion 5 or higher".

Virtual Machine &gt; Settings &gt; Compatibility

Then go to **Virtual Machine &gt; Settings &gt; Processors & Memory** and
expand the **Advanced Options** to select **Enable hypervisor applications
in this virtual machine**.
