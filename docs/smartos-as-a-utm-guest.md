# SmartOS as a UTM Guest on Apple Silicon

## Detailed Guide

[UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) is a virtual machine host for macOS based on QEMU.

Currently installing SmartOS on UTM with Apple Silicon is experimental.
If you are new to SmartOS and want to try in a VM, it would be best to try this
on a host with x86_64 architecture (Intel/AMD). The instructions here are
intended for testing and development use cases.

Because running SmartOS under UTM on Apple Sillicon requires using full
emulation, the experience is not as good as it would be using x86_64 hardware.
Issues users have encountered include tasks taking a very long time and zones
failing to provision or boot.

The settings below should be sufficient to get a SmartOS vm running under UTM.
There may be additional performance improvements to be made, and the guidance
may require updates as changes are made to UTM.

Note: KVM and bhyve guests are not supported when running under full emulation.

1. Download and verify the latest SmartOS iso image from the
  [downloads page][dl]
1. In UTM, click "Create a New Virtual Machine"
1. Select "Emulate"
1. Select "Other"
1. Under "Boot ISO Image" choose the image you downloaded

### Devices (optional)

- Add a new serial device
- The default built in terminal can be used that will open when the VM is started
- TCP Server Connection can also be used to select a port and connect over TCP
- PseudoTTY can also be used which can then be used with the `screen` command
- For more information on serial devices in UTM please refer to the
[UTM documentation](https://docs.getutm.app/settings-apple/devices/serial/)
