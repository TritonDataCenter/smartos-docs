# SmartOS as a UTM Guest on Apple Silicon

## Detailed Guide

Currently installing SmartOS on UTM with Apple Silicon is not stable.
If you are new to SmartOS and want to try in a VM, it would be best to try this
on a host with x86_64 architecture (Intel/AMD).
The instructions here are intended for testing and development use cases.

Issues users have encountered include long boot times and failure to create
zones once installed.
A recent test took approximately 15 minutes from boot menu to install screen
enabling multicore roughly halves the boot time.

1. Download and verify the latest SmartOS iso image from the [downloads page](https://us-central.manta.mnx.io/Joyent_Dev/public/SmartOS/latest.html)
1. In UTM, click "Create a New Virtual Machine"
1. Select "Emulate"
1. Select "Linux"
1. Under "Boot ISO Image" choose the image you downloaded
