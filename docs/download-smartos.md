* [Download SmartOS ISO][download-iso] - For running in Virtual Box or VMware
* [Download SmartOS USB Image][download-usb] - For booting on real hardware
* [Download SmartOS VMware VM][download-vmx] - Ready-made image for VMware.
  (Note: Do not use the first disk presented during disk selection (`c0t0d0`).
  This is the boot media and overwriting it will make the machine not boot
  anymore).

### Understanding SmartOS Builds

There is a new build, on average, every 2 weeks. SmartOS builds do not
have a version number, rather they have a timestamp in the form:
20120809T221258Z (in this example, the date is: 08/09/2012 at 22:12:58
UTC)

For any given build, there will be 5 files available:

* **platform-*(timestamp)*.tgz**: The raw kernel and boot\_archive;
  this is most commonly used for PXE booting
* **smartos-*(timestamp)*.iso**: Live Image ISO
* **smartos-*(timestamp)*-usb.img.bz2**: Live Image USB image for booting
  real hardware. This is the preferred installation method for production
* **smartos-*(timestamp)*.vmwarevm.tar.bz2**: VMware Image (VMX Format)
  *Note: Make sure nested virtualization is enabled if you want to use
  KVM or BHYVE.*
* **SINGLE\_USER\_ROOT\_PASSWORD.*(timestamp)*.txt**: Contains the
  default root password for the live image (needed only when booting
  without mounting the zpool)

For a full list of changes in each build, please refer to the
[SmartOS Change Log][changelog].
