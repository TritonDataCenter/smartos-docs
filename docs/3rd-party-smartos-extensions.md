# 3rd Party SmartOS Extensions

The broader SmartOS community has put together extensions to the SmartOS
core to enable additional and different functionality. While encouraged,
these are not supported by Joyent. If you have any issues with these,
please contact the folks who maintain them.

## Additional Software Repositories

EveryCity has made available an additional set of packages and
repositories. For more information on using it and getting started,
[read the instructions](3rd-party-software-repos.md).

## Additional KVM features

Spice is like VNC, but with support for audio and better performance.
[Read on](spice-on-smartos.md) for more information on how to get started.

## Additional Management Tools

[Project FIFO][fifo] is a web management system that provides some of the capabilities
of [Triton][triton].
