## Yes, this is relevant!

To understand illumos and the illumos community, it helps to know the
history of who we are and where we all came from, both corporate and
personal. Much of how the illumos community operates is based on decades
of operating system development, especially from the people behind Sun
Solaris.

Some/much of the below (so far) comes from
[Bryan Cantrill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cantrill)'s talk
[Fork Yeah! The Rise and Development of illumos][fork-yeah]
(embedded above) given at USENIX LISA, December, 2011.

## SunOS: A peopleʼs history

It all starts with
[Sun Microsystems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems).

- In the early 1990s, after a painful transition to Solaris, much of
  the SunOS 4.x engineering talent had left.
- Problems compounded by the adoption of an immature SCM, the Network
  Software Environment (NSE).
- The engineers revolted: Larry McVoy developed a much simpler variant
  of NSE called NSElite (ancestor to git).
- Using NSElite (and later, TeamWare), Roger Faulkner, Tim Marsland,
  Joe Kowalski and
  [Jeff Bonwick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bonwick) led a
  sufficiently parallelized development effort to produce Solaris 2.3,
  "the first version that worked".
- ...but with Solaris 2.4, management took over day-to- day operations
  of the release, and quality slipped again.

## Solaris 2.5: Do or die

- Solaris 2.5 absolutely had to get it right — Sun had new hardware,
  the UltraSPARC-I, that depended on it
- To assure quality, the engineers took over, with Bonwick installed
  as the gatekeeper. He gave a talk on Solaris to the Sun Systems
  Group in September, 1994. It included a section on the
  [Quality Death Spiral][qds] - a timeless phenomenon that remains
  our omnipresent fear.
- Bonwick was granted authority to "rip it out if itʼs broken" — an
  early [BDFL][bfdl] model, and a template for later generations of
  engineering leadership. (bmc says: "This is the only model for
  software development that ever works; no one has ever been able to
  develop software democratically.")
- Solaris 2.5 shipped on schedule and at quality. Engineers were
  making risk decisions now, not management, and they would never
  again relinquish control of the risk management of the
  operating system.

## The rise of the Bonwick Youth

- In the mid-1990s, it became a foregone conclusion that UNIX would
  die at the hands of Windows NT (!)
- Hard to believe, but Sun was the *only* computer vendor whose
  Windows NT strategy was to beat Windows NT
- Sunʼs dedication to this vision — the operating system as a nexus of
  innovation — attracted an entire new generation of engineers to the
  company
- New generation became known as the "Bonwick Youth"
- As talent attracted talent, there emerged an opportunity to become
  to OS innovation in the 2000s what Xerox PARC was to computing
  innovation in the 1970s

## Revolutionary ideas

By mid-2001, the trajectories set out by the move from SunOS 4.x to
Solaris a decade prior had reached their logical conclusion. The OS
worked, rock solid and feature-full. Development started on more radical
ideas, each of which would become revolutionary in its own right. A
bunch of headstrong engineers each had ideas they wanted to explore, and
Sun allowed for that (because no one was in control).

- [ZFS](http://wiki.illumos.org/display/illumos/ZFS) (née Pacific) -
  Jeff Bonwick had long wanted to rewrite file systems from scratch
  and eliminate volume management entirely.
- DTrace - Bryan Cantrill was sick of systems that were sucking and
  not knowing why. Worked with Mike Shapiro and Adam Leventhal to
  develop DTrace.
- Zones (née Project Kevlar) - (Jerry Jelinek) Taking FreeBSD Jails to
  their logical conclusion, what you needed by now was not a virtual
  machine, but a virtual operating system that can run without
  performance penalty.
- Fault Management Architecture (FMA)
- Service Management Facility (SMF, née Greenline)
- FireEngine/Crossbow
- Least Privilege

These all came together in Solaris 10.

## The wellspring of innovation

- These were technologies invented and initiated by *engineers*, not
  managers or marketers.
- These projects reflected the *people* behind them, and their
  *personal* histories with the operating system.
- Each of these projects represented an *opinion* — born of both
  experience and frustration ("the kiln of unspeakable pain") — about
  what the operating system should be.
- **Organizations donʼt innovate — people do.** You can't take an
  innovative organization, remove the people, and get innovation.

## Open source?

- As the rise of Linux (and particularly x86) forced the market price
  of OS acquisition to zero, it became clear that *open sourcing the
  operating system* was the right business decision
- The OS had always been a *loss-leader* for Sun; the company made
  money from complementary goods (hardware, support, etc.)
- Moreover, open sourcing the system would assure that our innovations
  would transcend products and become *advances* in the state of the art
- This was entirely in character for the company that had pioneered
  "open systems" some fifteen years prior! Sun had created NFS and
  ported it to its competitors' platforms in the late 1980s.

## Open source!

- Starting in the late 1990s, there was serious talk of open sourcing
  the operating system...
- ...but in a system with deeply proprietary roots and a troubled
  legal past, it takes a lot more than just talk
- In 2004, Jonathan Schwartz made it a priority to open source the
  operating system
- In January of 2005, OpenSolaris was born when DTrace became the
  first of the system to be open sourced
- The rest of the OS was open sourced in June 2005
- The OS was developed in the open from that point — changes to the OS
  were open source as they integrated

## Leaping the proprietary chasm

- Very, very few established software projects have leapt the chasm
  from proprietary to open
- Unfortunately, not all elements of the OS could be open sourced;
  some contracts prevented some small (but important) bits from being
  open sourced
- To allow for such proprietary drivers, Sun developed a file-based
  copy-left license, the Common Development and Distribution License
  ([CDDL](http://smartos.org/cddl/)) - approved by
  [OSI](http://www.opensource.org/).
- Contrary to public claims by some ex-Sun employees, this was *not*
  done to be deliberately GPL incompatible! It was necessary to allow
  for proprietary drivers.

## OpenSolaris challenges

- That certain critical bits had to remain proprietary made forking
  the operating system technically difficult...
- And that virtually all Solaris implementation knowledge lived within
  Sunʼs walls made it a practical impossibility
- The community had the *right* to fork, but not the *power* This led
  down the primrose path to open source governance: governing boards,
  elections, constitutions
- And because all development on the system realistically required
  copyright assignment to Sun, OpenSolaris (sadly) remained a Sun
  puppet
- Worse, some among Sunʼs middle management fancied
  themselves puppeteers...

## The "OpenSolaris missile crisis"

- In fall of 2007, Sun decided to create a new OpenSolaris-based
  distribution called... OpenSolaris
- Rightfully, the OpenSolaris Governing Board (OGB) was upset about
  this — it made the community that much more of a charade to have its
  very name hijacked
- Humanity-wasting governance orgy ensued...
- A compromise was reached in the end that allowed for de-escalation,
  but it became clear that — despite stated intentions — Sun did not
  want an independent OGB
- The community was deflated; OGB composition became more and more Sun
  dominated, and OpenSolaris was in the doldrums for the next three
  years

## The end of an era

- Ailing Sun was bought by Oracle in 2009, with the acquisition
  closing in February 2010
- Sun was concisely eulogized by Scott McNealy:
  - *Kicked butt, had fun, didnʼt cheat, loved our customers,
    changed computing forever.*
- After the acquisition closed, it became clear that Scottʼs eulogy
  was (ironically?) the antithesis of Oracle
- Over 2010, it became clear that Oracle had absolutely *no* interest
  in OpenSolaris
- Despite that it would be obviously stupid, there was even a move
  within Oracle to actually *close* the system!

## Meanwhile, the birth of illumos

- Starting in the summer of 2010, Garrett D'Amore at Nexenta — with
  help from Rich Lowe, Jason King and others — began the process of
  either writing the closed bits from scratch or porting them from BSD
- By early August, an entirely open system was booting
- Dubbed "illumos" (from *illuminare*, Latin for illuminate) and
  [made available on August 3, 2010](http://wiki.illumos.org/display/illumos/illumos+Project+Announcement+-+August+3%2C+2010).
- Notably, the announcement included both code and a working demo —
  leading with technology, not rhetoric
- illumos was *not* designed to be a fork, but rather an entirely open
  downstream repository of OpenSolaris

## The undignified death of OpenSolaris

- On Friday, August 13th, 2010, an internal memo was circulated by the
  putative Solaris leadership:
  - *We will distribute updates to approved CDDL or other open
    source-licensed code following full releases of our enterprise
    Solaris operating system. In this manner, new technology
    innovations will show up in our releases before anywhere else.*
    ***We will no longer distribute source code for the entirety of
    the Solaris operating system in real-time*** *while it is
    developed, on a nightly basis.*
- Greatest act of cowardice in the history of open source: this was
  never publicly announced; it was simply leaked
- Updates silently stopped on August 18th, 2010
- On top of that, it was a lie: Solaris 11 was released on November 9,
  2011 — and there was no source release

## The Solaris diaspora

- The Solaris diaspora (which was already underway) was greatly
  accelerated by Oracleʼs depraved act
- Within 90 days, the entire DTrace team had left Oracle, all primary
  inventors of ZFS had left Oracle and primary engineers for both
  zones and networking had left Oracle
- Fortunately, Oracleʼs loss was illumosʼs gain: nearly all of these
  engineers went to companies betting on illumos (Joyent,
  Nexenta, Delphix...)
- It is no surprise that these engineers have continued to innovate —
  and that a year later, their innovations (big and small!) have
  landed in illumos

## The illumos innovation irony

- There is no copyright assignment in illumos; code is under the CDDL,
  but copyright remains with the holder
- But with the closing of Solaris, Oracle itself no longer abides by
  the CDDL — which it can only do because it was assigned copyright on
  all community contributions
- However, Oracle does *not* own copyright on the illumos innovations;
  it cannot take this code back until it abides by its own license!
- In illumos, we have seen critical innovations and bug fixes in ZFS,
  DTrace, Zones and other core technologies
- *These innovations will never be in Oracle Solaris*
- illumos is the repo of record for critical OS technologies!

## ZFS

- Most core ZFS engineers now in illumos community: e.g. Matt Ahrens,
  Eric Schrock, George Wilson, Adam Leventhal, Bill Pijewski and
  Brendan Gregg
- ZFS engineers from several different illumos-based companies formed
  a joint ZFS working group
- First concrete technology artifact was a proposal for SPA versioning
  that allows disjoint features from different vendors without
  requiring conflicting versions
- That this was a most pressing problem speaks for itself: many
  different companies are betting big on illumos ZFS!
- Matt Ahrens added the "refratio" property to understand the
  compression win for referenced data
- Matt Ahrens added the ability to get estimated progress for zfs send
  and receive (!)
- Bill Pijewski and Jerry Jelinek added Zones-based I/O throttling,
  allowing for optimal disk operation in light of multi-tenant demands
- Dan McDonald and Sunit Gupta implemented UNMAP for STMF, allowing
  for better ZFS-backed iSCSI LUNs
- Many bugs fixed!
- ...and [more](http://wiki.illumos.org/display/illumos/DTrace)...

## DTrace

- Virtually all DTrace engineers are now in the illumos community:
  Adam Leventhal, Brendan Gregg, Eric Schrock, Dave Pacheco
- Added a log-linear quantization action (llquantize()) Added KVM
  support with vmregs\[\] variable
- A bunch of little stuff: allowed tracemem() to take a variable-size;
  added toupper()/tolower(); allowed lltostr() to take an optional
  base
- Added USDT provider reaping (a long-time issue) Eric Schrock added
  the CTF-aware print() action!
- dtrace.conf 2012

## Zones

- Primary zones engineer (and JumpStart tech lead!) Jerry Jelinek is
  very active in the illumos community
- Particular focus on high-tenancy systems; it is highly likely that
  the machines that run the most number of zones in production are
  doing so today on illumos
- Added many per-zones kstats (e.g. for CPU usage, VM activity, I/O
  activity, etc.)
- Reimplemented rcapd to be much more reliable, especially under heavy
  load
- Fixed many bugs related to many-zone configurations Added -z and -Z
  options to svcs

## KVM

- In addition to work on the traditional core technologies of ZFS,
  DTrace and Zones, we have added a new one: Joyent team ported KVM
  from Linux to illumos
- KVM makes use of hardware (specifically, Intel) virtualization
  support to allow one to run arbitrary x86 guests at nearly
  bare-metal speed
- Work was presented by Joyent at KVM Forum this year; currently
  running in production in the Joyent cloud
- illumos-based KVM has three distinct advantages over Linux-based
  KVM: ZFS, DTrace and Zones
- illumos distributions SmartOS and OpenIndiana have KVM support by
  default

## illumos Distributions

- There are already several illumos-based distributions, with more on
  the way
- OpenIndiana includes IPS packaging and has both server and desktop
  variants
- SmartOS is a Joyent distribution features NetBSD packaging and is
  designed for cloud computing
- illumian is a new Nexenta distribution that features Debian
  packaging
- OmniOS
- These distributions *complement* each other — they are growing the
  illumos pie more than dividing it!

## illumos community values

- We value the freedom to fork over governance; code over discussion;
  innovation over democracy
- David Clark of IETF fame put it best (h/t @kebesays):
  - *We reject: kings, presidents and voting*
  - *We believe in: rough consensus and running code*
- Instead of a BDFL, we have a benevolent oligarchy — and so far we
  have achieved consensus with little effort
- We value *utility*; we donʼt do things for their own sake!
- These values were embodied in the recent illumos hackathon (h/t
  @ahl), which was a resounding success!
