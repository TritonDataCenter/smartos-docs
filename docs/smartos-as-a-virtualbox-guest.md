# SmartOS as a VirtualBox Guest

## Quick Start

The best method for using SmartOS under VirtualBox is to download the
latest ISO image.

In VirtualBox, create a **New** machine. Set the OS as "Solaris 11
64bit". Attach the ISO image to the CD-ROM drive and selecte it as the
boot volume. Give the VM at least 2GB of RAM, preferably more.

Before booting the machine, go to the "Storage Section" and add another
hard disk (at least 20GB in size, preferably more) named "Zpool", VMDK
type, for your ZFS pool.

Some other recommended configuration changes are:

- Disable Audio
- Disable "Enable absolute pointing device"
- Enable PAE/NX
- Ensure Network is enable on Adapter 1 is of Type "Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop"

When you boot the machine and do the initial configuration ensure that
you use the secondary disk (likely named "c0t2d0") as your Zpool.
